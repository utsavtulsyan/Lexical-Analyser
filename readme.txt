    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Lexical Analyzer Project Overview
================================================================
The project has two directories:
1. Lex
2. lexical

Instructions for Lex:
	This part is created by using Lex and the coding language is Lex.

It has 4 files:

analyzer.l
    This is the main application source file. The analyzer is for C source code and is written in Lex.
    It is written in Lex and is given as input for the Lex generator. the Lex generator produces the lex.yy.c file.

lex.yy.c
	This is the C scource code generated by Lex. It contains the code whis analyses the code and generates tokens.

analyzer.l.bak
	It is the backup file created by Lex to save a previous version of the file without the most recent changes.

analyzer.exe
	This is the executable file created by C compiler which runs and gives the desired output, and takes the input.

Instructions for lexical:
	This part is coded only in C. It does most of the job and accepts a file as the input which conains the code.
	This has 7 files in total:

TOK.c
	This is the main application scource file. The analyzer is for C code and is written in C.

KEY.c
	This file contains all the keywords. The scource code accesses this file to get all the keywords.

OPER.c
	This file contains all the operators.The scource code accesses this file to get all the operators.

program.txt
	This file contains the test program. The scource code reads this file and generates the intermdiate file.

inter.c
	This file is created by the scource code and stores the tokens present in the input file.

TOK.o
	This is the object file generated by C compiler.

TOK.exe
	This file is the executable file generated by the C compile and runs to take the input and gives the output.
